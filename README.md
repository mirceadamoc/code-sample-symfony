# code sample symfony

this is a sample code of functionality integrated in a project I worked on.

this code is not working stand alone, the purpose is to assess my skills as php developer.

the task:
- in the workflow of the main app, after gathering all the data from the user,
a subset of data is sent to an external service (Microsoft Navision)
